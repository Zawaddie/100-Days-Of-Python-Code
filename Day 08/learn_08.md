# On Day 08:

## FLOW CONTROL: Loops
## For Loop:

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or any other iterable object. 
It executes a block of code a fixed number of times, based on the elements in the sequence.  

For Loop syntax:

          for item in sequence:
                 # Code to be executed

'item' represents the current element in the sequence, and the code within the loop will be executed for each element in the sequence.
