## FLOW CONTROL: Loops

 Loops are control structures that enable you to repeatedly execute a block of code. They help automate repetetive tasks and iterate over a sequence of elements. 

 These include:

         while loop 
         for loop
         nested loop

With a FOR LOOP, you can iterate over a sequence of elements or any iterable object.  
A WHILE LOOP executes its block of code as long as a specified condition remains true.

Both FOR and WHILE loops can be used to iterate over a sequence or perform specific tasks repeatedly. They provide flexibility in handling different scenarios and allow you to control the flow of execution in your program.

It's important to ensure that the loop conditions are properly defined to avoid infinite loops, where the loop never terminates.

## FLOW CONTROL: Loops
##  While loop:

A while loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a certain condition is true. It executes the code until the condition becomes false. The syntax of a while loop is as follows:
  
         while condition:
              # Code to be executed

The code within the loop will be executed as long as the condition remains true.
