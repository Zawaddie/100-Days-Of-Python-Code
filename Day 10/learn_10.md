# On Day 10

## FLOW CONTROL: Break and continue

The break statement allows you to exit a loop prematurely, terminating the loop and continuing with the next statement after the loop. 

The continue statement skips the remaining code in the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop.

## FLOW CONTROL: Try-Except: 

The try-except statement is used for exception handling. It allows you to catch and handle exceptions that may occur during the execution of your code. You can specify the code to be executed in case of an exception using the except block.

## Challenge_10 Palindrome Checker

Write a Python program that prompts the user to enter a word or phrase. The program should determine if the input is a palindrome or not. 

{A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads the same backward as forward.}

## pseudocode:

        - Prompt the user to enter a word or phrase.
        - Remove any spaces and convert the input to lowercase.
        - Use a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution.
        - If the input is a palindrome, display a message indicating that it is a palindrome.
        - If the input is not a palindrome, display a message indicating that it is not a palindrome.
        - Use break and continue to add extra functionality to the program e.g Use break to exit the loop once a valid input is provided.
        - Use continue to skip processing if the input is empty or contains invalid characters.
