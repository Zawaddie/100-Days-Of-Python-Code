# On Day 25

# Polymorphism:

- Polymorphism refers to the ability of objects of different classes to be treated interchangeably based on a shared method or attribute name.
- It allows objects to be processed uniformly, even if they belong to different classes, as long as they respond to the same method name.
- it enhances code flexibility, reusability, and extensibility.
- it is achieved through method overriding, which allows a derived class to provide a different implementation of a method inherited from the parent class.
