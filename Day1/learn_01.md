## On Day 01
I prepared my python Development Environment and started out on the challenge with the basic python syntax and data types:

## Printing Outputs in python
    print("Hello World")
learnt a new concept the use of sep=":" and end="PM" optional keyword arguments with the print() function to customize the behavior of the output. They allow you to customize the separator between printed items and the ending character, respectively.

## Variables and their assignments
Variables temporarily store data in computer’s memory. Acts as an address pointing to specific stored data
syntax:   variable_name = value
      name = 'Mackena' 
      age = 10 
      rating = 4.9 
      is_female = True

## Data Types
      • integer (a whole number without a decimal point) 
      • float (a number with a decimal point) 
      • string (a sequence of characters) 
      • boolean (can be True or False)

## Comments 
To add notes to code by explaining the hows and whys.
Not to explain the whats of the code as this is be reflected in the code itself.
