# 100 Days of Code Challenge

# Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge repository!
This is where I'll be documenting my coding journey over the next 100 days.

## About the Challenge
This is a commitment to code consistently for 100 days with the goal of improving coding skills and building a coding habit. 
In this challenge I will be reinforcing existing knowledge, learning new concepts, and building projects.

## Purpose of this Repository
This repository serves as a centralized hub to showcase my progress, share my code, and provide updates on my learning journey. Here, you'll find daily logs, code snippets, project updates, and reflections on the challenges and successes encountered along the way.

## Tracking Progress
I'll be updating the repository regularly with my daily progress, sharing the projects I've worked on, and discussing the concepts I've learned. By keeping this public, I hope to receive feedback and  also hold myself accountable throughout the challenge.

## Topics and Technologies
I'll be focusing on Python programming and explore various projects in:
- Automation with python
- Machine learning with Python
- Web Development with Django

## Get Involved
Feel free to explore the code and documentation in this repository. I appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or collaboration opportunities. 

Let's embark on this coding journey together!

Happy coding!
