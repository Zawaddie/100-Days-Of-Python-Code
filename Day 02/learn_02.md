# On day 2:
I focused on Arithmetic Operators in python which are special symbols or keywords that are able to operate on operands(values) and perform specific operations:

        - an operator is a symbol of the programming language which is able to operate on values.
        - expressions are  formed when data and operators are connected together.
        - through arithmetic operators, python can operate as a calculator.

## BASIC OPERATORS:
I learnt that there may be Unary or Binary operators.

Binary Operators perform the operations on two operands:

         +  Addition 
         -  Substraction
         *  multiplication
         ** Exponentiation
         /  Divion
         // Floor Divion
         %  Modulus

Unary Operators perform operations on a single operand:

         -    Negation
         +    Positive
         ~    Bitwise NOT
         not  Logical NOT

## Operation precedence
There is a set order of operation of operators
Exponential -> Unary  -> multiplication, modulus and Division -> Substraction and Division 

         **
         unary +, -
         *, %, /, //
         +, -

parentheses are used to change the operator precedence in operations of subexpressions

## Augmented assignment operator
There is an aurgmented assignment operator for all the basic arithmetic operators.
This operator writes the same normal code in a shortened way.
Normal code:
  
           x = 10
           x = x+3
           print(x)

use of augmented assignment operator:

          x = 10
          x += 3
          print(x)

## Challenge_02
write as simple program that prompts the user to enter two numbers. Then, configure the program to  perform various arithmetic operations on the two numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation and print the results.
